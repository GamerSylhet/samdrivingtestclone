If you take pride in your driving and like helping people to develop new skills this could be the ideal job for you. You need to be over 21, have held a driving license for at least 3 years and have not received more than 5 penalty points on your licence in the last 4 years.</span><br>
        <span class="spantext2">DVSA Approved Driving Instructor Training Course</span>
        <span class="spantext">To become a driving instructor you will need to purchase and succesfully completed our DVSA Approved Driving Instructor Training course.</span><br>
        <span class="spantext2">DVSA qualification needed to become a driving instructor</span>
        <span class="spantext">To legally operate as a driving instructor in the UK you are required to pass the DVSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) qualifying examination. The DVSA are the Government body who regulate driving instructors in the UK. But don’t worry if you are not academically minded the exams are very practically based. The driving instructor qualification process is in 3 parts:</span><br>
        <span class="spantext"><b>Part 1 </b>is a PC based multiple choice ADI theory and hazard perception test similar to the current test for learner drivers but you are required to answer 100 questions (not just 50) on a broader set of subjects and you need to score 57 as opposed to 44 on the hazard perception part.</span><br>
        <span class="spantext"><b>Part 2 </b>is a driving test, again similar to the current test for learner drivers but you are only allowed to make 6 minor faults (not up to 16 as on the L test). After passing Part 2 and completing the necessary training you can start your job as a driving instructor on what is called a Trainee Licence (earn while you learn).</span><br>
        <span class="spantext"><b>Part 3 </b>is an instructional ability test, which dramatically changed on the 1st January 2018. As a result the examiner now requires to watch you give a driving lesson to a real learner and depending upon what they see will determine if you pass this third and final part of the qualification process.</span><br>
        <span class="spantext2">DVSA ORDIT Approved Driving Instructor Training</span>
        <span class="spantext">The DVSA (i.e. the awarding and examining body) recommend you should only take training to become a driving instructor from organisations and trainers who are on the Official Register of Driving Instructor Training (ORDIT). ORDIT represents the absolute minimum qualification your trainer should have if you want any chance of passing the above ADI examination. But equally as important is the quality of the support, resources and training programme provided by the ORDIT accredit training centre itself.</span><br>
